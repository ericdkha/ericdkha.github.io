                    <p>Hi, I'm Eric! I come from the small town of Kalama, WA and I am currently attending the University of Washington with a goal of studying Informatics.<br>
                <br>I currently have experience and am constantly working to improve on skills such as full-stack development, working with relational databases, and UX/UI design.
                <br> I am also learning other tools, such as: the design thinking process, user research and working with qualitative data, and usability testing through my courses and education.<br>
                <br>I have a passion to help others through my work and my skills at hand that drives my desire to become more skilled in the various fields of information sciences.<br>
                <br>When I'm not busy with classes, I am usually enjoying what nature has to offer outside and you can find me up on a mountain or down on the lake. </p>

                            <p>In this project, the goal was for my team and I to work together to create an interactive  <a target="_blank" href="https://ericdkha.shinyapps.io/sleep_data_i498f/">website</a> displaying visualizations of a dataset of our choice. The dataset we chose was a survey conducted by the National Sleep Foundation in 2011 that asked various questions about a person's sleeping habits and activities prior to sleeping. Working with my group and with the help of GitHub, my team was able create several visualizations for different questions that could be asked of the dataset.</p>
                            <p>
                                Our target audience was general health professionals who might like to know about different activities may affect their patients' sleep and health.</p>
                            <p>For this assignment, my team members and I worked soley in RStudio, a powerful IDE for R. I had been learning how to code in RStudio throughout the quarter and this project was the culmination of that.</p>
                            <p>Teamwork was a fundamental component for completing this project. With a team of 5 working on the same code, we had to communicate and effectively manage different tasks to make this an efficient process. I thought this project was a great success and that it had contributed to my experience of not only data visualizations, but with working in a team-oriented environment as well.</p>

                            <p>In this project, I had the pleasure with working with Jennifer Chang, the University of Washington's School of Pharmacy Clinical Assistant Professor and Director of Preceptor Development to help create this video to recognize the introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) preceptor of the year for 2016.</p>
                            <p>Our goal was to make sure that the preceptors who took in pharmacy students were recognized for their hard work and time that they put in to make sure the students get the best experiences that will benefit them in their future pharmacy practice.</p>
                            <p>Being able to work on this project was a great opportunity for me to try conducting, filming, and editing a video at a professional level and I was able to gain invaluable experience from this.</p>

                            <p>I had the opportunity to work as an 'information broker' to the University of Washington's School of Pharmacy team to help them gather the necessary information needed to complete their pharmacy education poster to be submitted to the AACP. The data I worked with was mostly student data and survey results, combining them into a more readable format that can be later be used to extrapolate research questions and ideas for the pharmacy education poster. Going through the data, I had to run through it with a fine comb to make sure that I include as much relevant data as I can that relates to the proposal that the School of Pharmacy team is hoping to accomplish with their poster. I listen to feedback from my supervisors and went through the data step by step to make sure what I was presenting them was what the wanted.</p> <p>The poster proposal has been accepted by the AACP and the School of Pharmacy team was presented in late July of 2016 at the Annual AACP meeting in Anaheim, CA.</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted"> Going through the standard method that industry professionals use to design new information products and services</p> <a target="_blank" href="http://brendan610.wix.com/groupme-uw">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Info200.png" alt="wireframe picture"></a>
                            <p>This final project was a great introduction into the Information Science field. It combined the different steps that go into designing new information products and services such as starting with a problem statement and competitive analysis. For this project, my team and I decided to tackle the problem of the frequent occurrence of group members, in a classroom setting, being paired together that do not have common time to complete the group tasks outside of class which therefore decreases the efficiency of groups and group projects in general. Our competitive analysis looked at other services that provide a tool for groups to find time to meet, but only after the groups have been determined already. Other services required a subscription, and many others are time-consuming to utilize.</p>
                            <p>The next step in this project was to figure out who is our target audience. To do this, my team identified various direct and indirect stakeholder groups who would care about this problem and who would be affected by it. After identifying the various stakeholders, my team created detailed personas that represent our stakeholders and planned out how the personas would be affected by my team's proposed solution</p>
                            <p>The last step in this project is the designing of the information resource itself. My team chose to construct a <a target="_blank" href="http://brendan610.wix.com/groupme-uw">static website</a> that would be a mock-up of how our proposed solution would be implemented. In our proposed design, we mirrored as best we could the layout of most UW pages, so that the users would feel more comfortable using our service. My team also decided to have a resource for students and TA's because they are affected the most by our service and we wanted to cater the information resource to both audiences.</p><p>Overall, I was very happy with the end-product and the hard effort that my team had put into creating this information resource. My only regret is not being able to flesh out the mock-up in its entirety to make it more intuitive to navigate and utilize. </p>

                            <p>This assigment, as difficult as it may have been, might be the most beneficial assingment I have done thus far. With this assignment, the task was to take a lare csv file containing statistics from NBA players in the 2015-16 season and create a website where users can search for a specific player and see their stats. One of the reasons this task was so challenging was because it was a very open-ended assignment. With all other previous programming assignments, I was essentially given a spec to go off of with specific details of how the code should look and handle certain cases. The parameters of this assignment was to just make a csv file queryable by users and have the data returned in a readable format.</p>
                            <p>Most of my code was done in PHP and HTML/CSS to complete the website. Another challenge I face while creating this website was working with Amazon Web Services as it was a new 'tool' that I have never been exposed to. After many hours reseraching and learning how to navigate between my EC2 instance and RDS instance, I was able to finish creating this website.</p>
                            <p>I decided to format my website in a simple and familar layout. With a centered and single search bar, users of my website would know to do their query there, much like a Google search. My target audience was anyone who had the slightest of bit of interest in basketball, so I had to think about the wide range of users who were going to use this website.</p>
                            <p>When displaying the data for the user, I opted for a table-like format so that users can easily scan the headers and search for the specific stat they had wanted to see, or just see all of them at once. For special cases, such as common names like "Smith", I would display all the matches of "Smith" found along with some information about the player to the user and have them choose which "Smith" they may have been referring to.</p>
